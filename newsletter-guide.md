# Wise Words by SendOwl: Voice, Structure & Production Playbook

This guide is for producing Wise Words by SendOwl, a recurring newsletter from SendOwl in the voice of Dani Zacarias (GM). It ships on Klaviyo, goes out every Monday, and is designed for digital product creators who check email between tasks.

You and Claude will collaborate on each issue. Your job is to provide the raw inputs (seller stories, product updates, blog posts, industry links). Claude's job is to draft sections, maintain consistency with this guide, and catch voice violations. Think of it as a writing partnership: you bring the substance, Claude brings the structure and first drafts.

## 1. The Format: Why It Works

Wise Words by SendOwl is a habit-forming newsletter built for three reading speeds:

1. **The Scanner** (30 sec): The Number + Quick Wins headlines + The Closer
2. **The Skimmer** (3 min): All sections at natural pace
3. **The Deep Reader** (7 min): Full read + click-throughs from Link Stash

**Total target: 1,000 to 1,500 words (5 to 7 minute read)**

This is shorter than most operator newsletters by design. SendOwl's audience is busy creators who are building between school pickups, client calls, and day jobs. Respect their time and they'll keep opening.

### Habit-Forming Design Principles

- **The Number** = the cue (reason to open, takes 5 seconds, instant reward)
- **The Deep Dive** = the core value (reason to subscribe)
- **Quick Wins** = the scanner path (30-second read option for busy days)
- **Seller Spotlight** = emotional connection (real people, real stories, aspiration)
- **The Link Stash** = variable reward at the bottom (trains readers to scroll all the way down)
- **The Closer** = the dessert (the shareable line people screenshot)

## 2. Recurring Structure (Template)

Every issue follows this section order. Sections marked **Required** appear in every issue.

| A | **Header** | Required | n/a | Brand recognition, issue date |
| B | **The Number** | Required | 1-2 sentences | One stat about digital products that makes you stop and think |
| C | **Hey, it's Dani** | Required | 80-120 words | Personal, sets the theme, previews the issue |
| D | **The Deep Dive** | Required | 400-600 words | One topic, fully explored. The reason to subscribe. |
| E | **Seller Spotlight** | Required | 200-300 words | A real SendOwl creator's story. The emotional heart. |
| F | **Quick Wins** | Required | 150-200 words | 3 sharp, practical tips. Bold headline + 1-2 sentences each. |
| G | **What's New at SendOwl** | Optional | 100-150 words | Product updates, blog links. Only when worth sharing. |
| H | **The Link Stash** | Required | ~100 words | 4-5 curated links. The treasure hunt that rewards scrolling. |
| I | **The Closer** | Required | 1-2 sentences | A quotable line, provocative question, or surprising fact. |
| J | **Footer** | Required | ~60 words | About SendOwl, unsubscribe, links |

### Section Details

#### A. Header
- SendOwl brand colors: dark navy (#1a1a2e), accent orange (#ff6b35), white
- Issue date and "Wise Words by SendOwl" title
- Consistent across every issue for inbox recognition
- Built as HTML/CSS, not an image (faster load, more reliable rendering)

#### B. The Number
- One striking stat about digital products, creator economy, or selling online.
- Should provoke a reaction: surprise, curiosity, or validation.
- Format: the number in large text, followed by 1-2 sentences of context.
- Sources: SendOwl data, seller stories, industry reports, tweet content.
- Use a section emoji: **#** (consistent across issues)
- **Prompt for Claude**: "Write 3 options for The Number. Each should be a single stat that makes a digital product creator stop scrolling. Include 1-2 sentences of context. Source from [this week's content]."

#### C. Hey, it's Dani
- 2-4 short paragraphs.
- Starts with "Hey, it's Dani." (no emoji, no wave, just the name)
- Sets the issue theme without being a table of contents.
- Should feel like a note from a friend who texts you interesting things, not a CEO writing a company update.
- Can briefly preview what's in the issue in the final paragraph.
- Use a section emoji: **&#9993;** (envelope, consistent across issues)
- **Prompt for Claude**: "Write an opening note for this issue in Dani's voice. The theme is [X]. Start with a personal hook. Keep it under 120 words."

#### D. The Deep Dive
- One idea, fully explored with stories and specifics.
- Opens with a story, stat, or provocative statement (never "In this section we'll explore...").
- Build from tweet thread content, blog posts, and Dani's perspective.
- Includes a key insight called out in bold or as a standalone paragraph.
- Closes with an observation or forward-looking statement (not a rhetorical question every time).
- Should include a concrete takeaway the reader can apply.
- Use a section emoji: **&#128269;** (magnifying glass, consistent across issues)
- **Prompt for Claude**: "Write a Deep Dive based on [topic]. Source material: [paste tweets/blog content]. One concept, 400-600 words. Open with a story or stat, include a bold key insight, close with a takeaway."

#### E. Seller Spotlight
- Opens with the most compelling detail from the seller's story (not a bio).
- Include 1-2 photos from the SendOwl blog (download to images/ folder).

- Use a section emoji: **&#127775;** (star, consistent across issues)
- **Prompt for Claude**: "Write a Seller Spotlight for [name] from [business]. Lead with the most surprising detail. Here are the source tweets and blog content: [paste]. Include specific numbers and quotes. 200-300 words."

#### F. Quick Wins
- Exactly 3 tips per issue. No more, no fewer.
- Each tip: **bold headline** + 1-2 sentences of explanation.
- Tips should be actionable within a day, not strategic advice.
- Pull from tweet advice content, blog tips, and seller stories.
- Use a section emoji: **&#9889;** (lightning bolt, consistent across issues)
- **Prompt for Claude**: "Write 3 Quick Wins from this week's content: [paste]. Each needs a bold headline and 1-2 sentences. They should be actionable today, not strategic."

#### G. What's New at SendOwl (Optional)
- Only include when there's a real product update, blog post, or announcement worth sharing.
- Frame through Dani's lens: "We heard you" or "Here's why we built this."
- Never filler. If there's nothing to share, skip the section.
- Use a section emoji: **&#128230;** (package, consistent across issues)

#### H. The Link Stash
- 4-5 curated links: mix of SendOwl blog posts and external articles.
- Each link: bold title + 1-sentence description.
- At least 2 SendOwl blog links, 2-3 external.

- Use a section emoji: **&#128279;** (link, consistent across issues)
- **Prompt for Claude**: "Curate 5 links for The Link Stash. Include [these SendOwl blog posts] and find 2-3 external links about [topic]. Each needs a bold title and one sentence."

#### I. The Closer
- 1-2 sentences maximum.
- Should be quotable: the kind of line someone screenshots and shares.
- Often reframes a theme from the issue in a memorable, unexpected way.
- Can be a provocative question, surprising fact, or sharp observation.
- Use a section emoji: **&#127922;** (microphone, consistent across issues)
- **Prompt for Claude**: "Write 3 Closer options for this issue. Theme: [X]. Each should be 1-2 sentences and quotable. Think 'the line someone would text to a friend.'"

#### J. Footer
- "Wise Words by SendOwl" header

## 3. Voice & Style Guide: Dani Zacarias

### Core Voice

Dani's voice is warm, direct, and grounded in the real experiences of SendOwl's sellers. She writes like a thoughtful friend who knows digital products inside and out. Not a CEO giving a keynote. Not a content marketer writing a blog post. A person who genuinely finds this stuff interesting and wants to share it.

**The guiding test**: "Would Dani actually say this to a seller she was having coffee with?"

### Core Voice Rules

1. **Short paragraphs.** 1-3 sentences max. Most paragraphs are 1-2.
2. **First person.** "I" for Dani, "we" for SendOwl the company.
3. **Direct address.** "You," talking to the reader, not about them.
4. **Stories and specifics first.** Concrete details over generic inspiration. Names, numbers, products, turning points.
5. **Opinionated but not preachy.** Dani has a take and earns it with evidence. She doesn't lecture.
6. **Signs off as "Dani."** Informal, first-name basis.
7. **Customer is the hero.** SendOwl is the enabler, never the star. The sellers and their stories come first.

### Punctuation Rules

- **No em dashes.** Never use the em dash character (---). Claude defaults to em dashes frequently, so search every draft for "---" and replace every instance.
- Instead, use:
  - **Periods.** Break into two sentences. This is the default choice.
  - **Colons.** When introducing a list, explanation, or payoff.
  - **Commas.** For light pauses or appositives.
  - **Parentheses.** For brief asides.
- En dashes are fine for ranges (e.g., "17-27%", "$5-8").
- Hyphens are fine for compound words (e.g., "10-year-old", "well-run").

**Examples of em dash replacement:**

| Instead of this | Write this |
|----------------|------------|
| "AI can write your ebook --- and that's a good thing" | "AI can write your ebook. And that's a good thing." |
| "the creators who are winning --- community builders, coaches, specialists" | "the creators who are winning: community builders, coaches, specialists" |
| "she runs a real LLC --- with real tax obligations" | "she runs a real LLC (with real tax obligations)" |

**When reviewing Claude's drafts, search the entire document for "---" and replace every instance.**

### Emoji Usage

- **Section header emojis only.** One consistent emoji per section header, used as a visual anchor for scanning. Same emoji every issue.
- **Subject line emoji.** One consistent emoji in every subject line for inbox recognition (TBD, possibly an owl).
- **Zero emojis in body prose.** None in paragraphs, tips, or the closer.
- **Never use emoji as bullet points or list markers.**

### Banned Patterns

These patterns are instantly recognizable as AI-generated or generic content marketing. They are banned from the newsletter.

**Structural Patterns:**
- "Not X, but Y" / "It's not about X, it's about Y" (binary contrast trick)
- "No X. No Y. Just Z." (consecutive negation)
- "Think bigger. Act bolder. Move faster." (imperative triads)
- "Enter: [thing]" (theatrical introductions)
- "And here's the kicker" / "But here's the thing"
- "Something shifted" / "Everything changed"

**Words and Phrases:**
- "Game-changer" / "supercharge" / "unlock" / "revolutionary"
- "In today's [anything]"
- "Let's dive in" / "Let's break this down"
- "Delve into" / "Furthermore" / "Moreover" / "Indeed"
- "Crucial" / "Cutting-edge" / "Groundbreaking" / "Innovative"
- "Leverage" / "utilize" / "facilitate" (when you mean use/do/help)
- "It's worth considering" / "It's important to note"
- "At the end of the day"
- "To your success"

**Formatting:**
- Em dashes used at all (see punctuation rules)
- Emoji as bullet points or list markers
- Arrow symbols as transitions
- Excessive bolding for fake emphasis

**Tone Traps:**
- Generic motivational framing ("you've got this", "the future is yours")
- Hustle culture language ("grind", "empire", "crushing it", "level up")
- Fake urgency ("you need to start NOW")
- Unearned profundity (dramatic statements without earning them)
- Overly positive everything-is-amazing framing

### What TO Do Instead

- Write like you're texting a specific person you respect
- Use concrete details: names, numbers, places, products
- Let the story carry the point without spelling it out
- Vary sentence length naturally (some long, some very short)
- Have an actual opinion, not a repackaged consensus
- Reference real SendOwl sellers by name with specific details
- When something is interesting, just say it plainly

### Before/After Examples

**Before (generic newsletter voice):**
> "Welcome to Wise Words by SendOwl! Each week we share tips, tricks, and inspiration for digital product creators who are looking to take their business to the next level."

**After (Dani's voice):**
> "Hey, it's Dani. A 10-year-old SendOwl seller has a more structured profit allocation system than most adult freelancers I know. Her name is Cataleya, she runs an LLC called Happy Stitches, and she's currently repaying a puppy loan from her net profits. I think about her business setup at least once a week."

---

**Before:**
> "It's important to note that AI is having a significant impact on the digital products industry, and creators should consider how this will affect their business strategies going forward."

**After:**
> "AI can generate a passable ebook in about 20 minutes now. That makes generic how-to PDFs a tougher sell than they were two years ago. The information was never the real value."

## 4. Image Strategy

### Approach
- **2-3 images per issue**, 70:30 text-to-image ratio
- **Download images locally** to `images/` folder from SendOwl blog
- **Primary source:** SendOwl blog seller stories (real photos of real creators)
- Verify each downloaded image is appropriate and high-quality

### Image Types Per Issue

| Type | Count | Source | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
| Header | 1 | HTML/CSS | Built as code, not an image. SendOwl brand colors + issue date. |
| Seller spotlight photo | 1-2 | SendOwl blog | Real creator photos. Download and resize to 600px wide. |
| Section dividers | HTML/CSS | n/a | Styled `<hr>` elements, not images. |

### Technical Specs
- Width: 600px (email standard)
- File size: under 100KB each, under 300KB total
- Format: JPEG for photos, PNG only for logos/transparency
- Alt text on every image (descriptive, not decorative)
- Design at 600px, display at 600px (Klaviyo handles retina)

### Image Optimization Workflow
1. Download from SendOwl blog using `curl`
2. Resize to 600px width using `sips --resampleWidth 600`
3. Compress to under 100KB using `sips --setProperty formatOptions 70`
4. Verify visually using the Read tool
5. Reference in HTML as `images/filename.jpg`

---

## 5. Klaviyo Technical Requirements

### Email HTML Rules
- **600px width** table-based layout
- **Inline CSS only** (no `<style>` blocks in production; Klaviyo strips them)
- **Total HTML size under 102KB** (Gmail clips emails larger than this)
- **`{% unsubscribe %}`** tag required in footer (Klaviyo compliance)
- **No JavaScript** (stripped by all email clients)
- **No external stylesheets** (blocked by email clients)
- **Tables for layout** (flexbox and grid are not supported)

### Image Handling in Klaviyo
- Upload images to Klaviyo's image library (do not host externally)
- Reference using Klaviyo's hosted URLs after upload
- During development, reference local `images/` folder
- Always include `alt` text, `width`, and `height` attributes

### Testing Checklist
- Preview in Klaviyo's preview mode (desktop and mobile)
- Send test email to Gmail, Apple Mail, and Outlook
- Verify total HTML is under 102KB
- Confirm `{% unsubscribe %}` renders correctly
- Check images load with alt text visible

## 6. Content Sourcing Playbook

### Where Content Comes From

| Source | What to Pull | Used In |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| SendOwl tweet calendar | Seller stories, advice tips, topic threads, engagement hooks | All sections |
| SendOwl blog | Seller story photos, advice posts, product updates, comparison guides | Seller Spotlight, Link Stash, What's New |
| Dani's blog posts | Voice reference, topic angles, product philosophy | Deep Dive, Hey it's Dani |
| Industry news | Creator economy trends, AI + creators, platform changes | Deep Dive, Link Stash |

### How to Source The Number
1. Scan the week's tweet content for striking stats (follower counts, revenue numbers, percentages).
2. Check SendOwl blog for data points in seller stories.
3. Look for external stats about the creator economy.
4. Pick the one that would make someone pause mid-scroll.

### How to Build a Deep Dive
1. Identify the week's strongest topic from tweet threads (4-8 tweet threads are ideal source material).
2. Cross-reference with related tweets, blog posts, and Dani's writing.
3. Draft an angle that has a clear opinion, not just a summary.
4. Structure: hook (story or stat), the problem, the insight, evidence from sellers, the takeaway.

### How to Write a Seller Spotlight
1. Start from the tweet thread (richest source material).
2. Pull the blog post for photos and additional details.
3. Lead with the most surprising or compelling detail.
4. Include specific numbers: revenue, followers, timeline, product details.
5. End with something aspirational or instructive.
6. Download and resize the seller's photo for the `images/` folder.

- Never uses banned words or patterns

### Examples
- `[emoji] The 10-year-old with a better P&L than most freelancers`
- `[emoji] 84,000 followers, zero as important as email`
- `[emoji] AI wrote an ebook in 20 minutes. Now what?`
- `[emoji] A broken arm, 40,000 downloads, and 15 years of sales`

## 9. Working with Claude: Quick Reference

### Claude's Tendencies to Watch For
- **Em dashes.** Claude loves em dashes. Search every draft for the em dash character and replace. This is the single most common fix.
- **Hedging language.** Claude may soften Dani's voice with "it's worth considering" or "this could potentially." Cut these.
- **Over-explaining.** Claude sometimes adds a sentence that restates the point. If the last sentence of a paragraph just rephrases the one before it, delete it.
- **Binary contrasts.** "It's not about X, it's about Y" is Claude's favorite structure. Rewrite these.
- **Generic closings.** If Claude ends a section with something vague, rewrite it with a specific statement.

### The Review Loop
1. **Draft with Claude** using the section-specific prompts in this guide.
2. **Read it aloud.** If it sounds like a blog, it needs another pass.
3. **Search for em dashes** and replace every one.
4. **Check each opening.** Does it start with a story or hook? Or a summary?
5. **Check paragraph length.** Nothing over 3 sentences.
6. **Verify banned patterns.** Run through the banned list.
7. **Ship it.**
